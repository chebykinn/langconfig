# typeconf init

Parameters: config-directory - path to the target config dir.

This command initializes the configuration directory and creates the boilerplate and npm package.

# typeconf compile

Parameters: config-directory - path to the target config dir.

Options: watch - run compilation on changes.

This command compiles the Typespec schema and materializes values to JSON.

# typeconf update

This command fetches the config and types from the config directory and adds it to the project.

You'll need to have `typeconf.config.ts` in your project.&#x20;---
title: Why Typeconf
---

Configuration is messy. We have many different formats, YAML, JSON, random ini
files, not to mention environment variables. It's hard to track changes and
easy to break stuff. So we thought let's add types there! Typeconf,
allows you to define types for your configuration and read it in your code.

Typeconf pursues two main goals:

- Make configs easily shareable between services. Typespec schema allows you to
read config between different languages and services. Second advantage is NPM -
every configuration directory is just an NPM package which you can easily install
and get configs.

- Reduce editing errors. Having schema and strict typechecking that supports custom
validations, should greatly reduce the number of errors caused by mistyping configs.

# Installation

```bash
npm install -g @typeconf/typeconf
```

## Setup configuration directory

Typeconf manages all configs in a separate directory. Think of it as a configuration repository or package for your project. So, to start using the tool first you need to create the repository:

```bash
typeconf init <configs-dir>
```

With this command, we'll generate all the necessary boilerplate for you. Before starting editing the files you can this command in a separate terminal window:

```bash
typeconf compile --watch <configs-dir>
```

It will recompile the schema and config value on every change for convenience. You can always just run `typeconf compile` after any change yourself.

## Create new config

Now you can edit the `main.tsp` file, add your types, and then use `values.config.ts` to fill the config.

```typescript
model DebuggingConfig {
  enableLogging: boolean;
  maxRetries: int32;
  timeout: duration;
}

model PetServiceConfig {
  showBreed: boolean;
  petTypes: string[];
  debugging: DebuggingConfig;
}
```

This file is a Typespec schema, please refer to their docs for more examples: [https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/overview/](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/overview/)

<Info>
  Remember to run `typeconf compile` to update the types.
</Info>

## Set config values

Now, to update the config values, edit the file `src/values.config.ts`:

```typescript
let debuggingConfig: DebuggingConfig = {
  enableLogging: true,
  maxRetries: 10,
  timeout: "500ms",
};
let config: PetServiceConfig = {
  showBreed: true,
  petTypes: ["dog", "cat"],
  debugging: debuggingConfig,
};

export default config;
```

After recompilation you should be able to see the output JSON file in the `out/` directory.

## Use config in your code

<Warning>
  Currently, we only support Typescript, but later we'll add other languages.
</Warning>

To start using your config first you need to configure the typeconf :).

Install SDK package to your project:

```bash
npm install --save @typeconf/sdk
```

Create a file called `typeconf.config.ts` and add your config directory:

```typescript
import * as typeconf from '@typeconf/sdk'

const config: typeconf.Config = {
    configs: [
        "./configs",
    ],
};

export default config;
```

To fetch the config or update it after any schema changes you should run this command:

```bash
typeconf update
```

Read the config in your code:

```
import {ProjectConfig} from "@/typeconf-gen/all";
import {readConfigFromFile} from "@typeconf/sdk";

let projectConfig: ProjectConfig = readConfigFromFile("path/to/config.json");
```---

# What is Typeconf

Typeconf allows you to define and read configuration with types. Using
[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) you can define schema for your config and with
Typescript you can then set values for this config and generate a JSON file
suitable to be read by your service. In the service itself Typeconf generates
the same config types that you can use to read the JSON file without errors.

Typeconf is:

* Open-source

* Available via npm

* Can be adopted to existing codebase

* Ideal for automated flows (like hooks and CI)---
title: Setting up project
---

We use pnpm monorepo for managing the project. Right now this guide is quite simple as we don't have much testing yet.

# Install dependendecies

```
pnpm install
```

# Build

```
pnpm build
```



# Run examples

```
pnpm typeconf compile $PWD/examples/simple
```
