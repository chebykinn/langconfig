## Working with Typeconf

Typeconf manages all configs in a separate directory. Think of it as a
configuration repository or package for your project. In the config directory
there are three main parts:

* Schema, located at `src/main.tsp`

* Values file, located at `src/values.config.ts`

* Output JSON file, located at `out/<config-name>.json`

## Setup configuration directory

To start using the tool first you need to create the configuration directory:

```bash
npx create-typeconf-package@latest <configs-dir>
```

With this command, we'll generate all the necessary boilerplate for you. Before
starting editing the files you can this command in a separate terminal window:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

It will recompile the schema and config value on every change for convenience.
You can always just run `npm run build` after any change yourself.

## Create new config

In Typeconf you define configs with schema and values separately. We describe
schema in language based on Typescript called [TypeSpec](https://typespec.io).

To change the schema locate the file at `src/main.tsp`, here's a simple example of schema:

```typescript
model DebuggingConfig {
  enableLogging: boolean;
  maxRetries: int32;
  timeout: duration;
}

model PetServiceConfig {
  showBreed: boolean;
  petTypes: string[];
  debugging: DebuggingConfig;
}
```

Please refer to their docs for more examples:
[https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/overview/](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/overview/)

<Info>
  Remember to run `npm run build` to update the types.
</Info>

## Set config values

Now, to update the config values, edit the file `src/values.config.ts`.
Here's the counterpart example for the schema above:

```typescript
import { DebuggingConfig, PetServiceConfig } from '@root/types/all.js'
let debuggingConfig: DebuggingConfig = {
  enableLogging: true,
  maxRetries: 10,
  timeout: "500ms",
};
let config: PetServiceConfig = {
  showBreed: true,
  petTypes: ["dog", "cat"],
  debugging: debuggingConfig,
};

export default config;
```

## Getting the output JSON file

After editing the schema and values you should be able to locate the JSON file
in the `out/` directory. Please make sure that you have ran `npm run build`
or that you have `npm run build:watch` running in the background.

## Use config in your code

<Warning>
  Currently, we only support Typescript, but we intend to add other languages later.
</Warning>

To start using your config you can just install your configuration package that
you just created simply as a dependency!

After that you'll be able to read it from any JSON file you provide:

```typescript
import { ProductConfig, readConfigFromFile } from "you-config-package";

let conf: ProductConfig = readConfigFromFile("path/to/config.json");
```

Pro tip: If you want to use the configs package before pushing it there is a handly tool, run it in your project:

```
npx link@latest <path/to/package>
```
