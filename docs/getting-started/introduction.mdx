# What is Typeconf

Typeconf allows you to define and read configuration with types. Using
[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) you can define schema for your config and with
Typescript you can then set values for this config and generate a JSON file
suitable to be read by your service. In the service itself Typeconf generates
the same config types that you can use to read the JSON file without errors.
With Typeconf you can manage configs as code and easily share them between projects
using NPM.

Typeconf is:

* Open-source

* Available via npm

* Can be adopted to existing codebase

* Ideal for automated flows (like hooks and CI)
