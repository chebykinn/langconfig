# What is LangConfig

LangConfig allows you to define and read configuration with types. Using
[TypeSpec](https://typespec.io) you can define schema for your config and with
Typescript you can then set values for this config and generate a JSON file
suitable to be read by your service. In the service itself LangConfig generates
the same config types that you can use to read the JSON file without errors.

LangConfig is:
 - Open-source
 - Available via npm
 - Can be adopted to existing codebase
 - Ideal for automated flows (like hooks and ci)

## Commands

langconfig new config-name

langconfig compile config-name

langconfig use config-name
